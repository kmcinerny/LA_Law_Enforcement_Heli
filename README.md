# Assessing the raced and classed patterning of helicopter surveillance in Los Angeles



Los Angeles County supports the largest fleet of law enforcement helicopters in the world. Across the LAPD, LA Sheriff's Department, Police Departments of Pasadena, El Monte, Glendale, and the Interagency Metropolitan Police, 24 law enforcement helicopters surveil Angelenos. The sounds of their engine and rotor blades slapping the air thousands of times per second are not spread evenly across the county, as the trajectories of these aircraft are determined by predictive policing algorithms that have been found to criminalize Black, brown and low-income communities (Benjamin, 2019; Mather & Winton, 2015; Wisti, 2021). Helicopter noise, combustion emissions, and surveillance pattern life in LA in a way that has been felt by millions yet insufficiently documented. Utilizing a digital humanities approach to geospatial data analysis, I will study the spatial patterning of helicopter surveillance in Los Angeles County to assess its consequent psychological, biological, and social impacts on differently racialized and classed people and neighborhoods.
